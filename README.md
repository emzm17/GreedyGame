The app is made using the MVVM architecture design pattern. I separated UI and business logic. In this app, we can search songs based on genre, and we can get full artist details as well as album details. Most of part of the code I don't write error-handling part always write  the success part. Use CardView for showing images  and also used recycler view any list that i want to display in my app.
